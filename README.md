# nrf52840-LED-hat
sent messages to a cheap LED hat

This LED hat came with an app to change the text. I used my android phone to snoop the bluetooth messages and then used an (Adafruit nrf52840)[https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062] with CircuitPython to write my own messages to the hat.  

In this case it is counting down the minutes for my last day of work!
