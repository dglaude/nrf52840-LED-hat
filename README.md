# nrf52840-LED-hat
sent messages to a cheap LED hat

This LED hat came with an app to change the text. I used my android phone to snoop the bluetooth messages and then used an Adafruit nrf52840 with CircuitPython to write my own messages to the hat.  

In this case it is counting down the minutes for my last day of work!
